         *
         * A `static` field is like a counter on the wall of the car factory itself,
         * labeled "Total Cars Built". This counter doesn't belong to any single car;
         * it belongs to the factory (the class) as a whole. Every time a new car is
         * built, the factory updates that one single counter.
         *
         * WHY NOT ACCESS VIA INSTANCE (e.g., `myCar.getCarCounter()`)?
         * It's misleading. It looks like I'm asking my specific Mustang for the
         * total number of cars ever built. It implies the value belongs to `myCar`,
         * but it's actually shared by ALL cars. The code will work, but it's bad practice.
         *
         * WHAT'S THE BETTER WAY?
         * Access it through the class itself: `Car.getCarCounter()`. This clearly shows
         * the information belongs to the `Car` factory/blueprint, not an individual car.
         *
