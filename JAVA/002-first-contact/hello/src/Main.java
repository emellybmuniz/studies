/*
 * Println vs print 
 * println() prints the string and moves to the next line, while print() prints the string without moving to the next line. (\n)
 * 
 * Printf vs println
 * printf() allows for formatted output, similar to printf in C, while println() simply prints the string as is.
 * 
 *  Java have a bold type system, which means that variables must be declared with a specific type (e.g., int, String) before they can be used.
 * 
 * keywords: are reserved words in Java that have a predefined meaning and cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., class, public, static).
 * 
 * Upper case and lower case letters are significant in Java, meaning that variable names and class names are case-sensitive (e.g., myVariable and MyVariable are different).
 * 
 * Main.java
 * In Java, the file name must match the public class name. If the public class is named Main, the file must be named Main.java.
 * 
 * Main.java vs Main.class
 * Main.java is the source code file written in Java, while Main.class is the compiled bytecode file that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) can execute.
